Arity-generic decorators in Haskell
===================================

This started out as a fancy Haskell call-tracer and was then generalized to a Haskell decorator library.

The current, generalized library is described in a rejected [ICFP Functional Pearl](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~ntc2/haskell-decorator-paper.pdf).

Older documentation describes the earlier, call-tracing focussed library:
